              The underlying economy of ATUM Asset is the ATUM Token. The token
              is needed for two reasons. Firstly, the sale and purchase of
              digital assets and secondly, access to extra features and beneﬁts
              within the app, such as the ’Master Asset Program’. When a
              purchase is made using ATUM tokens, the tokens involved in the
              transaction are exchanged for the digital Asset and then expire.
              After a successful purchase the invalid ATUM tokens are sent to an
              inaccessible smart contract where they reside permanently. ATUM
              Asset users can acquire ATUM Tokens using a credit or debit card,
              or where applicable, via an in-app purchase. When via in-app
              purchases, the payment will seamlessly purchase an amount of ATUM
              tokens (determined by the user) and once the ATUMs are acquired
              they are used to purchase the digital Asset. This process happens
              entirely in the background.

            Prospective purchasers of ATUM Tokens (as referred to in this
            Whitepaper) should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and
            uncertainties associated with ATUM, and their respective businesses
            and operations, the ATUM Tokens, the ATUM Initial Token Sale and the
            Secure Wallet (each as referred to in the Whitepaper), including all
            information set out in this Whitepaper prior to any purchase of ATUM
            tokens. If any of such risks and uncertainties develops into actual
            events, the business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and
            prospects of ATUM could be materially and adversely affected. In
            such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the ATUM
            tokens. The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, including any
            digital currency, digital assets and blockchain applications is
            unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The publication and
            dissemination of this document do not imply that any relevant laws,
            regulations and rules have been complied with. No regulatory
            authority has examined or approved this document. Where any relevant
            governmental authority makes changes to existing laws, regulations
            and/or rules, or where ﬁnancial institutions make certain commercial
            decisions, it may have a material adverse effect and/or impair the
            ability of any relevant entity referred to in the document to
            function as intended, or at all. There are risks involved in the
            technologies relating to the Ethereum blockchain, and the ATUM
            tokens, such as unforeseen bugs, security issues or disruptions. By
            way of the above and other factors not within our control, the
            entire sum used to purchase the ATUM tokens may be lost. ATUM may
            contract with third parties to develop and license their products
            and/or technology for use within the ATUM Ecosystem. While ATUM will
            take all commercially reasonable steps to secure the necessary
            rights and licenses, there are risks and uncertainties associated
            with the business and operations of such third party contractors
            that are beyond ATUM’s control and they may not deliver on the
            products and/or technology. There is also a risk that ATUM does not
            succeed in obtaining and/or renewing the necessary rights and
            licenses to such third party products and/or technology mentioned in
            this Whitepaper. Such events may have a material adverse eﬀect on
            the function, deployment and use of the ATUM Ecosystem as intended.
            This Whitepaper does not identify, or claim to identify, all the
            risk factors connected with ATUM and its businesses and operations,
            the ATUM Tokens, the ATUM Initial Token Sale, and the ATUM Wallet
            (each as referred to in the Whitepaper). The disclaimers set out
            above are not exhaustive. A more comprehensive list will be set out
            in other documents that may be published by ATUM from time to time.
            You must make your own independent evaluation, after making such
            investigations as you consider essential, of the merits of
            participating in the Token Sale and after obtaining your own
            independent professional advice. To the fullest extent possible,
            ATUM shall not be liable for any responsibility, liability, claims,
            demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
            nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of
