          Digital Asset pricing within the ATUM Asset app will be displayed in
          both ﬁat and ATUM tokens. As ATUM Asset targets the American Indian
          Tribes & mass market, representing payment in familiar terms (ﬁat) is
          key for adoption. It is likely that over the natural progression of
          time the ATUM token value will ﬂuctuate based on supply and demand. By
          pricing digital assets in ﬁat, ATUM can ensure any ﬂuctuations in the
          ATUM token value will not aﬀect the Asset price.

          Assets are organized into categories and brands, with search and ﬁlter
          tools allowing users to easily ﬁnd the content they seek. Each user
          has an intelligent store data proﬁle which oﬀers personalized content
          suggestions based on what they have viewed, purchased or interacted
          with. Users can purchase digital assets from the store using ﬁat or
          ATUM. When the purchase is completed the digital Asset is removed from
          the store and ownership is transferred to the purchaser.

          In the ATUM Asset secondary marketplace users can connect, buy, sell,

          owner can choose how they want to sell the digital Asset either sell
          at a ﬁxed price or via a seven-day auction, which requires a reserve
          (set by the seller) to be met, in order to complete the auction. Items
          in the marketplace can be added to the users personal watchlist so the
          activity can be monitored. Users can also make oﬀers to swap or trade
          any item in the marketplace.

            A key feature of the ATUM Asset product suite is the Augmented
            Reality (AR) tools. Using this technology, ATUM Asset allows users
            to bring their ATUM digital assets out of the phone and project them
            into the real world, when viewed through the ATUM Asset mobile app.
            When viewing an ATUM Asset digital Asset in AR, the digital Asset is
            like a real world <br />
            <br />
            object - the user can move around it and view it from all angles.
            Using the AR, <br />
            <br />
            Also connecting to major brands to allow real time purchase in the
            AR that will be actual physical delivery to the user provide address
            / Drop location. <br />
            <br />

            ATUM Asset users can interact with their assets such as move them
            around the real world environment or engage in ATUM game
            experiences. In addition, users can customize their assets and
            decorate the surrounding area with props and accessories, then view
            (and share) these creations in AR also. <br />
            <br />
            Users will have the ability to scale the AR content to match their
            environment, whether that be a small size on a table top, or scaled
            up to ﬁll an open outdoor area. ATUM Asset AR is placed into the
            real world in one of the following ways - on a ﬂat surface (AR
            technology will locate and detect a ﬂat surface and then place the
            AR elements on top), ﬂoating in space, on a reference point, or
            based on a geolocation. <br />

          importance the onboarding and purchasing of ATUM tokens remains a task
          that can be easily carried out by consumers with zero knowledge or
          understanding of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. To facilitate
          this, users will acquire ATUM tokens using credit or debit cards, or
          in-app purchases. When a purchase is made using ATUM tokens, the
          tokens involved in the transaction are exchanged for the digital Asset
          and then expire. After a successful purchase the invalid ATUM tokens
          are sent to an inaccessible smart contract where they reside
          permanently.
